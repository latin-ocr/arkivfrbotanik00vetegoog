this precious scientific collection was lost to Sweden, and
that those who brought about the sale havc been subject to
reproach. But at the same time we have reason to rejoice
that Linnaeus’s herbarium, that »Palladium oi sciencea¹ iell
to the magnanimous and generous English nation and came

into the hands ol enlightened and noble men, who have .

always treated this collection with unparalleled marks of
honour and the most scrupulous care, first Dr. J. E. Sulru
and alter his death tbc Linnaean Society.

When we know the widely dillused inlerest in natural
history which existed in Swedcn in Linnaeus’s days and the
extensive correspondence Linnaeus carried on with the collec-
tors and scientists ol his time, we should be led to expect
theta number of plante had been bestowed by Linneeus on
his friends and disciples and thus remained in Sweden‚
when his own herbarium was sold to England. Wc have
indeed heard from tirnc to time that some small number of
plants from Linnaeus’s herbarium was to be found in the
possession of now this, now that still surviving person or
institution, to whom they had descendcd from older times.
Thus e. g. the herbarium belonging to Linnaeus’s eminent
disciple Dr. J. G. wistron (1724-1807) was recovered in
Kalmar in the year 1870, and amongst it was found a small
collection oi plants lrom Linnaeus's herbarium, which is now
the property ol the Botanical Museum oi Uppsala University.²
In the Bergion herbarium ol Bergielund near Stockbolm pre-
sented to the K. Svenslra Vetenskapsakademien by Linnaeus's
disciple, Prol. P. J. Banorus (1730—1790), about 30 plante
are to be lound classilied³ in Linnaeus's handwriting.

That Linneeus was by no means stingy with his plante
is clearly seen lrom passages in his letters. Thus e. g. he
writes to the archiater Asa. Bion of Stockholm (1773),·
albave kept two plante which are not to be lound in my

’ collection; in return I have enclosed 20, all capenses, and a

Zamia from Floridaa; and in the year 1769 he writes: »Gree-
tings to the magister Rnrzros and beg him leave me bis
