Delima, and he shall have 10 others quite as rare as this,
for my specimen is without fruit, which his hese.

Even from the comparatively small haul which Linnaeus
brought home lrom his jonrney in Lappland in 1732 he gave
specimens to Prof. J. Buarunrv of Amsterdam.l

In the botanical department ol the Naturhistorislra aius-
mueeet (Stochholm) the author has during the last two years

looked lor plante from Linne and has sueceeded in collecting
a considerable number. They have been found lor the most
part amongst bundles ol plants end in cases lrom old times
(the latter part of the 18th century), which in the course of
years (presumably about 1860) had been packed away in

lumbar-rooms, owing to went ol space, and were of course ⁸

bound to suffer injury lrom dust, scot, damp, and insects.
Thanks however to the indestructable paper and the old
method of gluing the whole plant last, these old specimcns
are comparatively well preserved, and many plante look as
il they had been quite reeently prepared.

These are precioue treesures from the great epoch ol our
natural history, which are thus again brought to light. Lin-
naeus himself has leid strecs on the importence of possessing
material which might serve ae a control in case a fresh in·
vestigation should be required, and especially with regerd to
hie own plante and original specimens he hes uttered the
following words: »Oviirderliga i sig ejiillva, med tiden mer
och mer begiirligae.² He clearly realized that his life and
activity hed been intimately bound up with the whole future
development ol botany. His collectione ere still in demand
and ere constantly being consulted not merely as relies lrom
the time when the »princeps botanicorum» himself was living
in the realm ol Flora, but as the most reliable eid to the
study ol his writings and es being as it were enswers out of
his own mouth to vexed botanical questions.

The collection ol plante, which has thus been designated
by the name »Linnaean herbarium», consiste firstly oi plante
which Linneeue himself possessed and furnished with names
