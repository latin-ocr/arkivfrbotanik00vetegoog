a very large part ol the botanical collectiones the Natural
History Muscam from the l8th century}

For his assistant and superintendant of his museum Al·
strdnrer had the zealous botanist Manus Danu (1751-1789),
who during the last years of Linnaeus's life had been his pupil
and visitor in his house. Dahl has on every sheet in the
Herbar. Alstrdmer noted with great acouraoy, from whom
the plant was obtained, and iu the cases when he himself
received a plant, he has also mades note of it. We thus
find, that he himself received a very considerable number of
plante 1) from Linnd (rDahl a Linnd Pa), 2) from Linne fil.
(rDahl a Linne 11), 3) from Hortus Upsaliensis while Lin-
nseus was still alive and during the years immediately after
his death.²

The greater part of these planta are furnished besides
with names or other inscription ‚by Linnaeus himself, as we
aee from his peouliar handwriting (and precisely in the same
way as the plante above mentioned out of the herbarium of
Linne fil.. see above). Their genuine origin direct from
Linnaeus is· besides recognizable by certain peculiarities in
the arrangement which are characteristic of Linnaeus’s great
herbarium. In his autograph memoirs oi himsell³ Linnd has
made the following statement as to his herbarium: »Det iir
lagdt i ordning efter genera, species och classes med utantill
pdslrrifne nomina specifica . .. Alla desse virter har jag in-
kllstrade med Ichthyocolla‚⁴ hvart species pa ett sarskildt
hallt arlr papper, och alla halfark, som hdra till samma genus,
har jag inlagde i ett helt pappersarlr, pla hvilket jag skrifvit
namnet al genus och pa halfarket namnet af species . .. Sd
simpel arrangering har icke blifvit pdtdnlrt fdrut›>.⁵

¹ The largest and most important collectione which are besides this
included in the oldest herbarium of the Natural History Murcum 1111111011-
rrru's and Osnucrr’s (both pupils of 11111111), and from about 1820 Swsnrz's
and Cassrnlinr's herbaria. See below!

specifica written on the autside . .. Ihave glued all these plante with isin-

which belong to the same genus I have enclosed in a whole sheet of paper,
on which 1 have written the narna ol the genus and on the hall-sheet the
name ol the species . .. Such a simple arrangement has not been thought
ol before.»
