C..A. M. LINDMAN, A LINNAEAN HERBARIUM. 7

Ιι should however be observed that instead of the name
of the species Liunaeus often writes a number referring to
the number in its genus in »Species plantarum» (usually ed,
1, 17533 occasionally an initial which refers ιο the new speeies
in Systema naturae, ed. 10, arta). According ιο O. Hanu-
transt Linnaeus in his great herbarium wrote merely numbers
or ciphers but not names on sheets which may be considered
as duplicatos and which lie next to a shaet on which the
name is written. Occasionally a cipher is found in pencil;
thereby Linnaeus (according to Hartman p. 9) meant to de-
signate merely the number of tho plant within its genus in
the plantcasa. As no'genus is given and the speciosis only
designated with a cipher, it is hard ιο identify the plant, if
the specimen is in any way defective. In many cases how·
ever the generio name is also written iu a large hand on
the top of the sheet, sometimes in Linnaeus's handwriting,
sometimes in that of his son. The name and number of the
species on the other hand is often written by Linnaeus with
very small often overlooked signs. The name is written on the
sheet itself. Only in his younger days, tojudge hythe hand-
writing, did Linnaeus write the names on labels with a
berder print-edinapretty decorative roooco pattern. Specimens
from that time moreover have often the picture of a vase
or an urn pasted under them. Even among Dahl’s plants
there are many ιο be found which show that the father and
son not seldom collaborated, for plante with the designation
»Dahl a Linnc' P.» sometimes have a species name written
in the handwriting of theson, and viceversa. (The hand-
writing of Linne fil. is somewhat larger and more legible,
but less neat and pleasing than the father’s). Linnaeus has
often added other signs, c. g. K (Kalm)‚ L(Liifling)‚ Monsp.
(Montpellier), H. V. (Hortus Upsaliensis)‚ Lapp. S. (Lapponia,
scandar), India, Algir(!) eto. etc² On the back of the sheet
Linnaeus not unfrequcntly wrote a longer designation, usually
a synonym from Cassan Baunrn or others. But a number
of plante which were evidently owned by Linnaeus are quite
undetermined and have indeed never received names from
him, as they are wanting in his writings, and were first
described by Vana, Wrmnauow, Larianus, and others.
