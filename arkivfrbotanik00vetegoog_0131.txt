tin's plenta ere glued on the etcutest and etiiiest paper that
one can lind in herbaria oi that date, and he has devoted
enormous care to the arrangement, preservation, and getup

ci the herbarium. No other of the older collectore has sacri- .

iiced even approximately so much time and trouble to iurnish
his plante with complete annotatione. Lebels are not met
with, nc more than in other contemporary collectione (the
small slips which are occasionally to be seen on Linnaeus's
herbarium sheets have got into the herbarium from the collec-
tion and often bear merely a number or a provisional classi-
fication, most complete in the case oi Kalm, Liiiling and
· Kiinig). Montin has used only the back oi the sheet ior hie
annotatione. Eacb sheet has not merely complete genus and
species (the genus in large and more or less ornate hand-
writing), but also the diagncsis out oi Spcc. plant. or Syst. nat,
the domicile of the specics (area) and the nature of the locality,
and finally informaticn as tc the collector, tbe country oi collec-
tion and the person who sent Montin the specimen, and often
also the year.

llrom these annotatione we lind thet Montin carried on
an amanlingly extensive and regular correspondence with
both Swedish and foreign botanists‚ collectore, and travellers.
He is one of the most zealous and alert collectore oi his time
and has the great merit oi having absorbed in his herbarium
very precious collectione which were thus safed from destruc·
tion or oblivion.

Montin's herbarium thus contains a large number oi
original specimens from e. g. Tuunenno’s movele, amounting
to two or three thousand plants end perhaps forming the
greater part cl this herbarium; next come the planta sent

was leit to him by hia lete uncle Dr. Lars Montin. This collection consiste
of a large and care herb collection or herbarium, enclosed according to Lin-

mentioned a smallcr case with chelle. a collection oi skulls oi various nni-
mals, various minerals etc. etc.) ... all of which through the instrumentality
oi Herr sairanem, the mayor, has arrived bere saiely from Halmstad. A
special velue is rightly seton this collection, aa it is one oi the largest in
the kingdom, and the Academy has never possessed anything like it before.)
