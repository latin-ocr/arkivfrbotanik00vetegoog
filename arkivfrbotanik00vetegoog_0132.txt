also 10 several thousand sheets). In the same way the Na-

Baubo), Lilvumo (from Portugal and Spain), Osnuou (from
the Cape, India and Chius), Fousurlnn (sent through Vahll. -
collectione which otherwise are included 10 Linnaeus’s great
herbarium in London and have thus beenlost 10 Sweden.
Amongst other annotatione 10 Montin’s handwriting we
read scientifie observatione and data given by the collector;
about some ol them, e. g. those which Montin himself has
described (as e. g. EricaThunbergii) itis also stated where
the description was published. Besides this 00 nearly every
sheet there is an aoknowledgement or compliment to the
sender of the plant, 0. g. »Α destructione conservaris me
voluit celeb. Dmus Prol. .Joh. Leche specimen hoo Kalmi-
anum»; »Specimine hoc auxit collectiones meas Dmus Falck

All shows an enthusiasm and collecting zeal which well deserves
10 bo noticed and admired‚ and lcts us see the high valu'e
Montin sets both 00 seleuce itself and on the scientists per-
sonally. At the same time wo clearly realize what a high
opinion Mpntin had of his own well ordered and well osred

he gives a longer or shorter sketch ol the lile oi the botanist

Lechec minor e. g. he wrote a sketoh of Leche’s lile (Professor
at libo, d. 1761), taking up nearly the whole of the back oi
the sheet. In the ease ol Osbcclria abinensis he wrote a long
biography oi Osbeck 10 which the following passage occurs:
