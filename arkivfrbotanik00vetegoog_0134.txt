accordingly have beon permitted 10 collect planisio the aca-
demical gardan), or obtained by purchaso from persons who
received the planta from Hort. Ups., e. g. med lio. Hall, Sel-
berg, Salomon, and others. As to the gardener Nietzel, it
may reasonably bc celred how he could dispensa with such
'a large number 01 horbs, and auch numerous and fine speci-
mens 01 them. Whether thia took place with the permission
01 the director is a question which must remain ununswered.
The probability is that Montin compensated Linnaeus in Swedish
(and foreigni) planta, especially living planta ior the gurdon,
In a letter irom Ldiling (1761) we read that Montin likewiee
sent planta (111 erchangel) 1ο Jussieu.

Finally it should be mentioned with regard to Herb.
Montin., that a number 01 planta, but not ,a very considerable
one, were received from Linnaeus inparem, e. g. »Donum
Nobil. Arch. ct Equit. D:ni a Linnb>3 »Specimen misit Nobil.
Arch. et Equ. de Stella bor. D:nua a Linne»; 1101011101...
Liune hoo specimen communicavit ›>; likewiaa some from Linnb
fil: »Specimcn novae speciei ex Horto Upa misit 1101100010-
lus von Linne 17791, 010. etc.
