8011111111 herbarium.

In the oldest collectione 01 plants 01 the State Natural ¹

History Muscam a large number of well preserved plants are
to be found pasted on very thin but tongh and 111111 paper.

. On a number 01 these shcets hasbeen written (in Oasstro'm’s

handwriting) at a later period »Ex Herb. beati D. Solanderi»,
and the director 01 the botanical collectione J. Ε. Wilsstriim
has written on a large number 01 sheets »Herb 8011111111.
All these plants are (apert 110111 the quality 01 the paper)
easily recognizable through the fact that the name 01 the
genus is written in small elegant capitale cn the margin at
the top and the name 01 the species in the margin at the
bottom, both on the 110111 side; on the back is written in
an even free and beatilul hand the diagnosis and number
etc. in the Species plantarum ed. 1. A number 01 these
sheets carry besides a local designation aPiteaa, (Solander'a
native town), others »Tornoaa (Torneal, which makes it pro-
bable that they were collected by Solander, who in 1756
made a botanical journey through Pitc Lappmark and the
adjacent parts 01 Norway etc.¹ I the year 1760801111111111

¹ An argument in favour 01 these planta having been Solander'a 11
that Gentiana aurea L. Sp. pl. ed. 2. p. 331. nr 12, is to be found in the
collection (syn. Gentiana involucrata Rotae). Linneeua says in this passage
in Sp. pl. ed. 2, that the species grem =in Alpibus Lapponiae Norvegicae‚
D. C. Solander›; and on the sheet 01 the specimen in question 11 written
in the same handwriting as is hare presumed 10 be Solander's: »Tagen vid
Rbrstads Priistebord iNorrige; pt hardvallr (reollected near Rbrstad's
personage in Norway; on a dry pastura).
