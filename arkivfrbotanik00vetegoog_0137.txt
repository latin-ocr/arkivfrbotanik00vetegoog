maica plantsthnt Wikstriim has written »Herb Solandri ex
Herbario Linneei» or »Ex Herb. Linnaeano accepit Solander».
Ae to how Sclender'e herbarium got to the Natural History
Museum, only thie rnueh ie known that a number of these
plante belong to the large Herh. Cesetriim, which was left
by its owner S. N. Onssreen (1763-1827) to the K. Veten-
skepealradernien.¹

It ie possible that Limne fil. took over these plante from

Solander‚ who died in London in 1782 during Linne filze' ,

etay there.

Solander'e herbe are ae a rule very reliably cleeeified.
Some of thern heve no claeeification, because they had not
yet been described by Linnaeus. In some cases the name of
the speeies hae been inserted at a later period in the
handwriting of Linne iil. (It ie alreedy said that

ι Linne pater hae written the name in eome of the sheete).

It may therefore be assumed that a number of Selander's
plante remained after hie departrne in Linnaeus's herbarium
cr at least in »Herbarium parvum» (see above, p. 5).

It merely remaine to be mentioned that e small number
of plante, some from Linne, eome from Hort. Upe, seem to

cerry Ldnnrwes and Osnccrr’e handwritings. Similarly a few
Linnaean plante are met within Herb. Caeetriim. The an·

notatione in Linnaeue’e hand which are found on the sheete
have been certified by Caeetriim with the following written
werde: »Arctopraphon dici Linnaei».

The plante from Linnaeue (end Linnf fil), ae well as from
Hortus Upealieneis during Linnaeue’e lifetimc, which the Swe-
dish Natural History Museum thus pceeeeeee amount to about
2000. They have now been gathered together into a Her·
barium blancanicum, arranged according to Linnaeue’e system.
Ae a large number of these Linnaean plante have some note
in Linnaeue’e own hand and many of them arc very valuable
specimens‚ a liet of the herbarium should prove of use to

¹ According to a statement in Kongl. Vetenelreps·Aeademiens Handl.
of the year 1828. p. 288. where the information ie eleo given that this great
herbarium wae contained in 36 casce.
