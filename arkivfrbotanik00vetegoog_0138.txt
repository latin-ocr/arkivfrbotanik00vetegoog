science. The following list shows that many genera are very
well represented here, and in some cases all the species of a
Idnnaean genus are kept in this herbarium. In many cases
it is sufficient to quote the name of the species according to
Linnaeus (and Linne fil.); but in some cases it is necessary as
far as possible to add a new classification according to our
present views cf certain dubious species or series abouud·
ing in forms. Part of this work has been done by post-
linnaean notes on the plant-sheets, mostly by J. E. Wilrstriim
and S. N. Gasstrbm. Some few have besides been treated
by specialists in the middle of the leth century along with
the other herbarium material of oldest datc; thus e. g.
some Urticaceoe have been classified by Weddell, some Sper-
pulorioe by Kindberg, some Euphorbiaceoe by Miiller Arg.
(1863), some few Pleriilophytc by Bakor etc. But it still
remeius to subject these planta to comparative investiga·
tions, especially in the cases where distinct plante have re-
ceived the same name from Linnaeua although they mayevi·

dently be rechoned as separate species. Sometimes the cipher
given by Linnaeus is certainly without importance for the

knowledge of the species iu its genus and accordingly quite
misleading. A circumstance which is oi valuable aid in the
classification is that Linnaeus’s own often insignificant and
badly damaged specimen is completed by a large and very
well preserved specimen from Hortus Upsaliensis (through
Nietzel) in Montin’s herbarium. As accordingly these Lin-
naean planta deservo a critical investigaticn which might re·
quire a good deal of time in order to malie out if the speci-
men really belongs to the said species, cr any confusion
has been made by Linnaeua for the present only the begin-
ning of the listi. e. as far as Tetroadrio is publishedhcre,
and the rest will be given in a future pamphlet.

In the list now following, which in its order answers in
the main to Syst. Veg. ed. 13 (1774) and Suppl. plant. (1781),

will be found for every species firstly its name, and as far ¹

as possible the name of the species in Linnaeus, next (in
italica) a citation of the words or signs which Linnaeus and
